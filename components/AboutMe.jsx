            <h3>Fire Protection Designer / Software Development Student</h3>
            <p>As a Fire Sprinkler Designer at Archer Construction, Inc., I apply my skills in AutoCAD and AutoSprink to design, coordinate, and list fire suppression systems. I have over two years of experience in this industry, working on various building types and ensuring compliance with safety standards and regulations. 

I also have a strong background in electrical engineering technologies, having earned an Associate of Arts and Sciences degree from Bates Technical College. Additionally, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Software Engineering at Green River College, where I am learning about data structures and back-end tasks through a proprietary micro-internship at CodeDay.

My goal is to leverage my technical skills and knowledge to contribute to the development of innovative and safe fire protection systems and software.</p>
